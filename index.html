  <p><b><font size="6">What I think I  have learned so far</font></b></p>
<br>
<p><b>How the web works:</How></b></p>
There is the <b><em>user</em></b> who uses a browser to display the information on their computer screen.<br>
There is the <b><em>internet/web</em></b> which evnetually connects users to the desired content.<br>
There are <b><em>servers</em></b> which host the content.<br>
And <b><em>HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language)</em> </b>is the 'language' used for many of the content hosted on the servers.<br>
And, by the way, <b><em>HTTP</em></b> is how computers send requests for content to the server.<br>
<br>
<p><b>What is a HTML document:</b><br>
<br>
It can be text, images, videos, links, files, etc. 
Pretty much anything.<br>
It gives <b><em>instructions</em></b> on '<em>WHAT</em> people should see' and '<em>HOW</em> people should see it'.<br>
These instructions are very precise because computers are <b>STUPID</b> - they can and will only do what they are told to.<br>
A tiny spelling mistake by the programmer will not be just a tiny spelling mistake but the reason why the whole program doesn't work!<br>
An important thing to remember until we get used to it.<br>
We tend to take for granted how <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence>intelligent</a> human beings are.<br></p>
<br>
<p><b>The first baby steps:</b><br>
<br>
Tags: usually have an opening tag and closing tag<br>
Void tags:  don't require a closing tag because it has no content<br>
<br>
<b>Bold</b><br>
<em>Italics</em><br>
<p>Paragraphs</p>
Breaks<br><br>
Anchor tag: is for creating <a href=http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_a.asp>a link</a> <br>
Image tag: to show an <img src=http://www.online-image-editor.com//styles/2014/images/example_image.png alt="too bad you can't see the cute cat"> image<br>
Attributes: href (web address), src (source=where to find the image), alt (alternate=text displayed when image doesn't load)
, etc<br>
<b>Inline vs Block</b> elements:  'break' is <em>inline</em> and 'paragraph' is <em>block</em>.  A block is like an invisible block.<br>  
I've tried using both in different ways, for example, for the first section, I used paragraphs to create breaks, and for the second section onwards I've used breaks within a paragraph.<br>  
</p>
<br>
<p><b>You don't have to remember everything:
</b><br><br>

Last but not least, unlike learning <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edYHlnhxyOI>French</a>, <b>you don't have to memorize all the tags and attributes.</b><br>
We're allowed to use <a href=https://www.google.fr/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=html%20codes%20for%20text>Google</a>.<br></p>
